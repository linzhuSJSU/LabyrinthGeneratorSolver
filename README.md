# LabyrinthGeneratorSolver
A Team project consists 2 members. Objective: Design and implement Maze program that will automatically generate and solve mazes. 
This project includes: Design and implement program that generates and solves “perfect” mazes, where a maze has no inaccessible section, no circular paths, and no open areas.
Represented the maze as graph data structure and implemented the DFS and BFS to generate and solve the maze.
